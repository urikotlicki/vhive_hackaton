## Proposal #1: Fine-tuning a model:
* 100 sports Image Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification/discussion/data?sort=undefined
* CIFAR10: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
* Fine tune classifier - one-shot / CNN / ViT

## Proposal #2: Describe what you see on a webcam
* Use a segmentation model to segment an image
* Label each segment
* Print the data: "I see two persons, a blackboard and a door"

## Proposal #3: Convert an image into colorful pseudo-LiDAR
* Use a depth estimation model from monocular camera.
* Sample both depth map and RGB image by an even-spaced grid.
* Create a colorful 3D point cloud.
* Bonus: Add a label for each point.
